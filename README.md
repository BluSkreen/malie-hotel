# Fancy Hotel!

## Description:

For our final group project a single page MERN stack application was created for "The Malie" hotel. This application presents the user with a homepage for a luxury hotel providing details on the rooms, activities, dining and highlights of the hotel. The user is able to create an account or login to an existing account, at which point they are able to search by date for available rooms and create a hotel reservation.

## Tests

As a group we tested different aspects of the page and found bugs such as login authentication, and pages not loading at the top of the page. By working in a collaborative environment we were able to fix these bugs to provide a better user experience when visiting "The Malie" application.

## Screenshots

The following screenshot shows the wireframe for our application created using excalidraw when developing the layout of the page at the beginning of the project:
